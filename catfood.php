<h2>Orijen Cat And Kitten Foods </h2>
<img class="smallcenter" src="image/catFood/image1.jpg" ><br>
<p>
Orijen received a 5-star rating from the Pet Products Review, and it's well-deserved, considering it is nourishing and 'biologically appropriate.'  Orijen, which comes in dry formulas that can be served wet or dry, includes a variety of protein choices for cats and kittens.  It has a 75 percent protein content to a 25 percent fruit and vegetable content. In terms of high quality proteins, we are talking about things like real eggs, free range antibiotic free chicken and fresh wild caught fish. It is also grain free. Customers say that their pickiest of cats love this brand; the only negative comments are about the higher price of it as compared to some other cat foods. Clearly, the higher quality ingredients require the higher price tag. Orijen does not make a canned diet for cats.

<h2>Blue Buffalo Cat Food</h2>

<p>
5-Star-rated Blue Buffalo has a great reputation for quality ingredients and real meat, fish, or fowl is always the first ingredient.  Special recipes are made for kittens and mature cats in both canned and dry food varieties. Grain-free recipes are also available.
    Blue Buffalo's dieticians and veterinarians have developed a special method to preserve the natural and added vitamins and minerals in the dry food recipes.  Blue Buffalo has a ton of cat fans, but families warn of possible allergies to certain formulas. If your cat does develop an allergy to one of Blue Buffalo's recipes, try another formulation of its food.

<h2>Stella & Chewy's Cat Food</h2>

<p>
Stella & Chewy's cat food comes in two varietals; raw frozen and raw freeze-dried.  Raw frozen would have to be purchased locally from a pet store because it's meant to be defrosted only once - just before you cat eats it.  A very convenient way to purchase Stella & Chewy is in freeze-dried packages, as the original recipes are kept dry and hard until you add water just before serving.
    Stella & Chewy's offers organic meat, fish, and fowl recipes - hormone and antibiotic-free.  It is grain and gluten free, but the good stuff - taurine (a must for cats) and probiotics are added.  Because it is more pricey than many cat foods, Stella & Chewy's is the brand turned to when cats won't or can't eat anything else.  They do tend to fall in love with it pretty fast, but some actually prefer Stella & Chewy's in its dry state, rather than moistened with water.

<h2>Wellness Cat Food</h2>

<p>
Another 5-star cat food that's quite popular is Wellness, with its high quality proteins and vegetable mix, grain-free, and primarily protein varieties in wet and dry food.  No matter how fussy your cat is, you will find something in the Wellness line of cat foods that he really likes.
    Wellness uses no animal by-products in its formulations, something which sets it apart from some of its peers. It adds to its formulations: vitamins and minerals, flaxseed and salmon oil (for essential fatty acids), and taurine for healthy hearts and vision.

<h2>Taste of the Wild Cat Food</h2>

<p>
Taste of the Wild is another cat food brand that cats seem to like, which is always a plus. Owners like it too, although some would prefer to have chicken as the main ingredient rather than chicken meal.  But the reviewers support the brand, noting that it is less expensive than Orijen, but suggest that Taste of the Wild is great nutrition for a good price.  Grain free, Taste is made in dry and canned versions.
